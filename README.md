# Polychan
A 4chan desktop app because I hate the web!

[Polychan](https://polychan.net) is a desktop client for anonymous imageboards like 4chan. *(But currently only supports 4chan).*
It's not built on top of web browser technology; it uses its own GUI framework written from scratch to support a low resource footprint.
